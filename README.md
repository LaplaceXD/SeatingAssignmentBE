SeatingAssignmentBE is the backend service for the issue tracking and logging system made for the seats assigned in a laboratory. The primary stack used for this system is [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) for the front-end, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for the back-end, and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for the database.

## Functionalities

-   Track, validated, and manage logged issues for seats in a laboratory.
-   View issues by status, seats, and laboratories.
-   Track progress on validated issues.
-   Paper trail system for issue changes.
-   Role-based authorization on different endpoints.
-   Authentication using [Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sanctum).
